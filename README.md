# AMAZEMicrobiomeAnalysis

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the manuscript titled "Intestinal microbiome changes in response to amino acid and micronutrient supplementation: secondary analysis of the AMAZE Trial". This repository contains all the code and scripts used for the data analysis, visualization, and statistical tests presented in the manuscript. The code is organized and documented to facilitate reproducibility and transparency in our research.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`/Data/`**: Contains raw and processed data files used in the analysis. Note that some data files may not be included due to privacy or size constraints.
- **`/Code/`**: Contains all R scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **`/Docs/`**: Includes additional documentation, such as method details, supplementary information, and references.

## Dependencies

The analysis was conducted using the following software and packages:

- **R version**: 4.3.2
- **R packages**:
  - `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and visualization.
  - `phyloseq`: For microbiome data analysis.
  - `ggplot2`: For creating plots and visualizations.
  - `ggrepel`: For enhancing plot labels.
  - `ggpubr`: For arranging plots and statistical comparisons.
  - `ez`: For performing ANOVA and other statistical tests.
  - 'MicrobiomeStat'
  - '


## How to Use the Code

2. **Run the analysis**:
   - 1. `DataCleaning/`: This folder conatis all the code used to preprocesses the raw count data and prepares it for analysis.
     2. `Baseline_08_24.Rmd`: Performs statistical tests of the baseline mcirobiome data.
     3. `3. SupplementationAnalysis`: This folder conatis all the code used to anylse micrla changes after intervention
